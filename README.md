A breakpoint viewer for Chrome

## Contributors

You will need node.js and coffeescript to contribute to this project. There is a Cakefile with build and watch tasks which generate the extension file in ./build. You can then add this folder to Chrome's extensions (in Developer mode) for testing.

With that, fork away...looking forward to pull requests!
